  How much does an apprenticeship cost
  </h2>
  <p>Apprenticeships are free. The employer and training provider determine their costs together with government support. </p>
  <p> If you’re under 25 when you start your apprenticeship and have previously been in local authority care, you may be eligible for a bursary payment. </p>

 <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"> 
Who can apply for an apprenticeship
  </h2>
  
  <p> To start an apprenticeship, you’ll need to be: </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
      16 or over
    </li>
    <li>
    living in England
    </li>
    <li>
     not in full-time education
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p> You can apply for an apprenticeship while you’re still at school but you’ll need to be 16 or over by the end of the summer holidays to start the apprenticeship. </p>

 <h2 class="govuk-heading-m "> 
  What does an apprenticeship include
  </h2>
  <p>As an apprentice you will:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
      be an employee earning a wage and getting holiday pay
    </li>
    <li>
      work alongside experienced staff
    </li>
    <li>
     gain job-specific skills
    </li>
    <li>
    get time for training and study related to your role
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>As an apprentice, at least 20% of your normal working hours must be spent on training.
Your training might happen every week, every month or in a separate block of time.
 </p>

 <p> The training might take place:</p>
 <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
   <li>
     at your place of work
   </li>
   <li>
     somewhere else like at a college or training provider
   </li>
   <li>
    online
   </li>
 </ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m "> 
  Pay and working hours
  </h2>

<p> There are different rates of pay for apprentices depending on your age and what year of your apprenticeship you’re in. </p>
<p> Your employment contract should confirm your rate of pay but you must be paid the appropriate <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates"> national minimum wage (opens in a new tab)</a>. </p>
<p> You must be paid for: </p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    your normal working hours (found in your employment contract or apprenticeship agreement)
  </li>
  <li>
    training that’s part of your apprenticeship (at least 20% of your normal working hours)
  </li>
  <li>
    study towards English and maths qualifications, if they’re part of your apprenticeship
  </li>
</ul>

<p> There are rules about how many hours you can work in a week and being paid overtime. </p>
<p> You’ll get at least 20 days of paid holiday per year, plus bank holidays. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement">holiday calculator (opens in a new tab)</a> helps you check what you are allowed to take. </p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m ">

Real experiences

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s"> Alim</h3> 
  <p> "Being an apprentice has been the best time of my life, I've been able to do things that I'm passionate about. I've been able to meet so many different people. I've built up my confidence. It's been the best experience it could have been." </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-padding-top-6"> Hosanna </h3> 
  <p>"I found the confidence I needed to take the apprenticeship, because I knew theatre is what I loved and where I wanted to be.There's never really a typical day. There's always different working hours and different people, which is my favourite part of it." </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-padding-top-6"> Ella </h3> 
  <p> "I wasn't a hundred percent sure what I wanted to do after 6th form. Then, my mum showed me an ad in the local paper for an apprenticeship. I want to be earning six figures by the time I'm thirty. And that's the beauty of starting young, it's all possible." </p>
