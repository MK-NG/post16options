  How much does an apprenticeship cost
  </h2>
  <p>Apprenticeships are free. The employer and training provider determine their costs together with government support. </p>
  <p> If you’re under 25 when you start your apprenticeship and have previously been in local authority care, you may be eligible for a bursary payment. </p>

 <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"> 
Who can apply for an apprenticeship

    </li>
    <li>
    living in England
    </li>
    <li>
     not in full-time education
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p> You can apply for an apprenticeship while you’re still at school but you’ll need to be 16 or over by the end of the summer holidays to start the apprenticeship. </p>

 <h2 class="govuk-heading-m "> 
  What does an apprenticeship include
  </h2>
  <p>As an apprentice you will:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>As an apprentice, at least 20% of your normal working hours must be spent on training.
Your training might happen every week, every month or in a separate block of time.
 </p>

 <p> The training might take place:</p>
 <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
   <li>
     at your place of work
   </li>
   <li>
     somewhere else like at a college or training provider

   <li>
    online
   </li>
 </ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m "> 
  Pay and working hours
  </h2>

<p> There are different rates of pay for apprentices depending on your age and what year of your apprenticeship you’re in. </p>
<p> Your employment contract should confirm your rate of pay but you must be paid the appropriate <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates"> national minimum wage (opens in a new tab)</a>. </p>
<p> You must be paid for: </p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    your normal working hours (found in your employment contract or apprenticeship agreement)
  </li>
  <li>
    training that’s part of your apprenticeship (at least 20% of your normal working hours)
  </li>
  <li>
    study towards English and maths qualifications, if they’re part of your apprenticeship
  </li>
</ul>

<p> There are rules about how many hours you can work in a week and being paid overtime. </p>
<p> You’ll get at least 20 days of paid holiday per year, plus bank holidays. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement">holiday calculator (opens in a new tab)</a> helps you check what you are allowed to take. </p>
